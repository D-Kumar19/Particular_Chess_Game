# Particular_Chess_Game
This Game is similar to a Chess Game. Except a change that a Chess Game is (8×8) but this is just (2×3) and with that it has Less Number of Pieces too.

It is somehow more intersting Game than a Chess Game as it is not that super lengthy. As, it is just about some particular pieces of Chess like Bishop Rook and King. But there are two Bishops and two Rooks one of each is Black and one of each is White. 

Game is bit focused on King. We have to move King from one corner to another corner. And we have just one box empty. 

Have a try! Good Luck.
